# Wordifier
Wordifier is a Java application designed to iteratively learn and identify words from character-segmented text files. It employs algorithms to analyze sequences of characters, constructs potential words, and evaluates their validity based on predefined criteria. This tool is particularly useful for natural language processing tasks where word segmentation is required.

Features:
Processes character-segmented text files to identify potential words.

Utilizes iterative learning methods to improve word recognition accuracy.

Evaluates the quality of identified words using customizable metrics.

Usage:
Clone the repository: ```bash git clone https://github.com/Brian-St/Wordifier.git

Compile the Java source files: ```bash javac -d bin src/*.java

Run the application: ```bash java -cp bin Wordifier path/to/character_segmented_text.txt
